# CodeMastery Deployment Preparation

## Status and scope

Planning and verification methodology under [ADR002](decisions/002-interim-delegated-contracts.md), CT17.I-scope/CT17.I-access. No actual deployment, paid service, public exposure, credentials or production access approved or performed. Retain approved one-VM Docker Compose architecture and existing infrastructure. Selected externally demonstrated capabilities are real Auth and Course catalogue/detail; local mastery results remain separately reproducible. The official lecturer-accessible prototype remains mandatory.

## Preconditions and local validation

Merge reviewed contracts, obtain separate implementation and deployment authority, implement/test selected features and provide real non-secret endpoint/configuration choices. Follow existing [setup](setup.md) and [testing](testing.md) commands; do not invent deployment scripts. Existing repository checks include backend Maven Wrapper verification, frontend npm run build and the documented Compose configuration validation. Local bindings remain loopback. This task did not run application deployment or these feature-validation commands.

## Runtime and health

Runtime secret values are supplied out of band; no secrets in documentation or VITE_* variables. Use existing /actuator/health without detail exposure, then exercise actual feature APIs/browser. Health alone does not demonstrate implementation or correct database access. Production TLS/origins/provider/access policy and rollback authorization require Leader decisions.

## External verification and evidence

An independent tester outside the developer LAN verifies the actual approved HTTPS URL, Auth/roles and browser→REST→PostgreSQL catalogue/detail, hidden404 behavior, English data and no secret disclosure. Record real URL, revision/build, UTC/ICT time, browser, tester identity, role and redacted expected/observed results. Stop on TLS/origin failure, data exposure, wrong authorization, placeholders or local-only access. Preserve failures and corrective evidence. Actual accounts/endpoints and lecturer instructions are external inputs, not invented values.

## Recovery and submission

Record actual deployment steps, backups/rollback procedures and responsible operator when separately authorized. Do not reset data or publish credentials. Link verified prototype and local mastery evidence to the English Interim report, contributions and submission documentation. No academic submission is authorized here.
